  <h1> 1.1.9 Project </h1>
  <h4>  For this project we made an interactive game that allowed users to create their own donut. We used if statements, named variables, looping, lists, and turtles to create this program. The trinket below allows for a demo of our program. Try it out for yourself if you want! Be warned: there are a few bugs since it is meant to run on VS Code.</h4>

  <h1> 1.2.5 Project </h1>
  <h4> For this project we made a cool twist on a popular game. We created a leaderboard, functions, while loops, if statements, and variables to create an interactive game. The user controls where the snake goes, eats food to grow and increase your score, and avoid mines. The photos below show snapshots of the game and models the leaderboard as well. </h4>

  <h1>   Scratch Project</h1>
  <h4> For this project we used a different cite than usual. We used a lot of block statements to create our game. Our game allows the user to control a biker, reach chekpoints, and race through different backgrounds to finish the race. </h4>

  <h1> 3.2.4 Project </h1>
  <h4> For this project we graphed the change in honey value in the year 1997. We worked on storing and using data in a chart to create the graph with the specific x and y axis that we wanted. </h4>

  <h1> 4.1.4 Project </h1>
  <h4> In this project we examined a program on NetLogo. We examined a simulation that represents a group of people unsatisfied and suppressed who choose to rebel against a police force. Different turtles represented police officers, rebels, civilians, and imprisoned rebels. It was very interesting to input different percentages and watch the impact that created on the police or rebel success. </h4>
