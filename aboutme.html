<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>My name is Ivana, but I've gone by Izzy (ever since second grade) because it bothered me when it was mispronounced. I am an eighteen year old senior. I plan on going to Cal Poly Slo this fall to study business, and later go into law. I love the outdoors and playing sports.</p>

<h2>surf club</h2>

<p>Surfing was something I started doing with friends during Quarantine. I never thought I'd end up becoming the president at RB's Surf Club! I helped raise over $1,900 to form a school competition team. We competed in the Scholastic Surf Series Tournament. I even won a few medals for placing which is something I never thought I'd be able to do. Surfing is my favorite hobby, and I will continue to surf in college.</p>

<h2>cru club</h2>
<p>I spend a lot of time as the president of cru club. I like making connections and building community on and off campus! I've been on the leadership team for cru before I was even an official high schooler. It was great to help build the club and its leaders to what it is today. It is a big hobby and commitment of mine that I put a lot of time and effort into.</p> </center>

<p>I am the Vice President of Communications for PC. I was one of the few sophomores to have been accepted into PC that year and have stayed in it ever since. We have a very important role on campus. I help tutor students and lead the club as an officer. I put a lot of my time into managing the social media and communication app to help the club run smoothly. It truly is amazing to be apart of such an organized club that makes such a difference on campus! </p> </center>
