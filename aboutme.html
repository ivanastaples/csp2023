<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>My name is Ivana, but I've gone by Izzy ever since second grade because it bothered me whenever it was mispronounced. I am eighteen years old since November and am a senior. I love the outdoors and playing sports.</p>

<h2>surf club</h2>

<p>Surfing was something I started doing during Quarantine with friends. I never thought I'd end up becoming the president at RB's Surf Club! I helped raise over $1,900 to form a competitive school team. We've competed in the Scholastic Surf Surf Tournament. I've even won a few medals for placing which is something I never thought I'd be able to do.</p>
