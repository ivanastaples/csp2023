<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>My name is Ivana, but I've gone by Izzy (ever since second grade) because it bothered me when it was mispronounced. I am an eighteen year old senior. I plan on going to Cal Poly Slo this fall to study business, and later go into law. I love the outdoors and playing sports.</p>

<h2>surf club</h2>

<p>Surfing was something I started doing during Quarantine with friends. I never thought I'd end up becoming the president at RB's Surf Club! I helped raise over $1,900 to form a competitive school team. We've competed in the Scholastic Surf Surf Tournament. I've even won a few medals for placing which is something I never thought I'd be able to do.</p>

<h2>cru club</h2>
<p>I also spend a lot of time as the president of cru club. I like making connections and building community on and off campus! I've been on the leadership team for cru before I even was an official high schooler. It was great to help build the club and its leaders. It is a big hobby of mine that I put a lot of time and effort into.</p> </center>

<center> <h2>peer counseling</h2>
<p>I am the Vice President of Communications for PC. I was one of the few sophomores to have been accepted into PC that year and have stayed in it ever since. We have a very important role on campus. I help tutor students and lead the club as an officer. It is amazing to be apart of such an organized club that makes a huge difference on campus!</p> </center>

<p>Of course I do enjoy a lot of other hobbies. I play piano, write, sing, skateboard, and bake!</p>
